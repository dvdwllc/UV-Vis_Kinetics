This repository contains a subset of the data analysis tools that I built for my work on reaction kinetics at solid-solution interfaces. The repository contains two folders:
<ul>
<li><em>tools</em>: contains scripts for importing/exporting data, as well as plotting and analysis tools for comparing many datasets.</li>
<li><em>data</em>: contains raw and processed datasets.</li>
</ul>
There are also and iPython notebook and two example scripts in the main directory, which provide a representative example of how the spectral fitting, machine learning, and data analysis are performed:
<ul>
<li><em>problem_statement.ipynb</em>: Coming soon.
<li><em>data_workup_example.py</em>: A self-contained solution to the problem outlined in <em>problem_statement.ipynb</em></li>
<li><em>analysis_example.py</em>: A brief example of how to use the plotting functions in tools.</li>
</ul>

The main reason for writing these tools in Python, rather than using a more high-level tool such as Origin, is the cumbersome format and sheer number of datasets obtained from scanning UV-Vis kinetics experiments. More to come...
